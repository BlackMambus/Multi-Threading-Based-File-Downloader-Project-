Multithreading-based file handling refers to a programming approach where multiple threads operate concurrently to read, write, or process files. This technique is widely used in systems where performance, responsiveness, and efficient resource utilization are critical.

⚙️ How It Works
Parallel Execution: Threads are created to divide file-related tasks, such as reading chunks of a file or writing data simultaneously.

Synchronization: Proper locking mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores are used to avoid conflicts when multiple threads access shared file resources.

Load Distribution: Tasks are split among threads so large files or datasets can be handled more quickly and efficiently.

Thread Pooling: Pre-created threads manage file operations dynamically, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads frequently.
